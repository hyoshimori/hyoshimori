### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hiroto originally from Japan and based in France. Having worked for a French start up for about 3 years as a translator, I am passionate about coding. With my sophistication and passion in both human and computer languages, I am looking forward to talking to both you and your apps.
