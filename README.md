## Front-End Developer

My name is Hiroto and I am originally from Japan, but currently based in France. I have worked for a French start-up for the past three years as a translator and I am passionate about coding.

I had the opportunity to study at Le Wagon and I was chosen to be a <a href="https://kitt.lewagon.com/newsletters/477/public_show?signature=aabc3f95f39b304e820a49d51f36674fbb9a1c25">Top Profile Student</a>, as I tried to pay attention to small details. This educational experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding of coding and solidified my passion for technology and creation. 

With my background in both human and computer languages, I am looking forward to communicating with both people and apps.
