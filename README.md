## Front-End Developer

Hi! My name is Hiroto. I have worked for a French start-up for about three years as a translator, where I became passionate about coding.

I had an opportunity to study at Le Wagon and I was chosen to be a <a href="https://kitt.lewagon.com/newsletters/477/public_show?signature=aabc3f95f39b304e820a49d51f36674fbb9a1c25">Top Profile Student</a>, as I tried to pay attention to small details. This educational experience has allowed me to deepen my understanding of coding and solidified my passion for technology and creation. 

I look forward to a fruitful learning journey ahead!
